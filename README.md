# ComputerDatabase
A Computer Database where frontend is developed with Angular and backend with Java Spring Boot. Database is still open. Communication from frontend to backend is based on REST.
This right now is a small prototype, although a lot of fixes and improvements needs to be made.
This project is made for learning purposes and to gain experiences with the learned technologies used in a project. End goal would be to deploy this application for usage at my current employer.

# TODOS

- Implement database (probably Postgress, but still to be decided)
- Implement date picker and radio buttons for form
- Implement search option for table
- Implement sort option for table
- Eventually change form 
  - change the passed data
