## CompTracker

The application maintains the computers of the company in a database, where the frontend is developed with Angular and
backend with Java Spring Boot. The Implementation of the Database is
still open. Communication from frontend to backend is based on REST.
This right now this is a small prototype, with fixes and improvements
needed to be made. This project is made for learning purposes and to
gain experiences with the adopted technologies used in the project. End
goal would be to deploy this application for usage at my current
employer.
